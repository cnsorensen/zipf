This is just me informally writing down what we need to do.

Create hashtable of 1K (prime value)
Create hash function, open addressing with linear probing
Read in text file
xParse ASCII chars into words (strtok()) 
Take out punctuations except for embedded single quotes
Read in words
For each word
    if word is not in table
        insert into hash table
    Count frequency
    if table >= 75%
        create table twice as large as current table to the next prime number up
        rehash contents into new table
        print message
Sort table using qsort(), by frequency first, then alphebetically

create two files using "filename" with the extensions "wrd" and "zpf"
